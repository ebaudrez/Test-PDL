Revision history for Test::PDL

{{$NEXT}}

 - added a function eq_pdl() to compare two piddles, without performing an
   actual test. If you've been wanting to compare two piddles outside of a test
   suite, now you can (Edward Baudrez)

 - minor bugfixes related to distribution building and hosting on GitHub. No
   functionality added or changed (Edward Baudrez)
 - fix the POD documentation to work with the PDL docs database scraper (David
   Mertens)
 - allow setting module options at use time:
      use Test::PDL -option => $value;
   Only options that would be accepted by Test::PDL::set_options() are allowed.
   Note that you must use the lowercased option name, preceded by a dash, when
   setting options this way. (Edward Baudrez)
 - require type equality by default when comparing piddles. If you don't like
   this behaviour, set the option EQUAL_TYPES to false, or use Test::PDL as
   follows:
      use Test::PDL -equal_types => 0;
